<p>The idea for this application was conceived during the interminable wait between submitting my skills assessment application and receiving a response.</p>

<p>Day in and day out, thoughts of getting a rejection or delayed response kept me on edge. More than anything, I wished for a clearer picture of the current processing times, seeing as the official guidelines aren't updated as often as we'd like them to be.</p>

<p>My goal is for future applicants to gain more insight into current trends than I had during my application, and this can only be done with more data. To that end, I request you to take a minute and log details of your ACS application if you've been through this yourself.</p>

<p>Lastly, I hope this helps alleviate some of the anxiety! &#128512;</p>
